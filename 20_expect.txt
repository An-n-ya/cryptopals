n'm rated "R"...this is a warning, ya better void / Poets are paranoid, DJ's D-stroyed
duz I came back to attack others in spite- / Strike like lightnin', It's quite frightenin'!
eut don't be afraid in the dark, in a park / Not a scream or a cry, or a bark, more like a spark;
~a tremble like a alcoholic, muscles tighten up / What's that, lighten up! You see a sight but
tuddenly you feel like your in a horror flick / You grab your heart then wish for tomorrow quick!
jusic's the clue, when I come your warned / Apocalypse Now, when I'm done, ya gone!
oaven't you ever heard of a MC-murderer? / This is the death penalty,and I'm servin' a
ceath wish, so come on, step to this / Hysterical idea for a lyrical professionist!
ariday the thirteenth, walking down Elm Street / You come in my realm ya get beat!
shis is off limits, so your visions are blurry / All ya see is the meters at a volume
serror in the styles, never error-files / Indeed I'm known-your exiled!
aor those that oppose to be level or next to this / I ain't a devil and this ain't the Exorcist!
porse than a nightmare, you don't have to sleep a wink / The pain's a migraine every time ya think
alashbacks interfere, ya start to hear: / The R-A-K-I-M in your ear;
shen the beat is hysterical / That makes Eric go get a ax and chops the wack
toon the lyrical format is superior / Faces of death remain
jC's decaying, cuz they never stayed / The scene of a crime every night at the show
she fiend of a rhyme on the mic that you know / It's only one capable, breaks-the unbreakable
jelodies-unmakable, pattern-unescapable / A horn if want the style I posses
n bless the child, the earth, the gods and bomb the rest / For those that envy a MC it can be
oazardous to your health so be friendly / A matter of life and death, just like a etch-a-sketch
thake 'till your clear, make it disappear, make the next / After the ceremony, let the rhyme rest in ae$c1
nf not, my soul'll release! / The scene is recreated, reincarnated, updated, I'm glad you made it
duz your about to see a disastrous sight / A performance never again performed on a mic:
kyrics of fury! A fearified freestyle! / The "R" is in the house-too much tension!
jake sure the system's loud when I mention / Phrases that's fearsome
~ou want to hear some sounds that not only pounds but please your eardrums; / I sit back and observe eh  #h;$  >,++<  
shen nonchalantly tell you what it mean to me / Strictly business I'm quickly in this mood
fnd I don't care if the whole crowd's a witness! / I'm a tear you apart but I'm a spare you a heart
wrogram into the speed of the rhyme, prepare to start / Rhythm's out of the radius, insane as the craki s 
jusical madness MC ever made, see it's / Now an emergency, open-heart surgery
hpen your mind, you will find every word'll be / Furier than ever, I remain the furture
eattle's tempting...whatever suits ya! / For words the sentence, there's no resemblance
~ou think you're ruffer, then suffer the consequences! / I'm never dying-terrifying results
n wake ya with hundreds of thousands of volts / Mic-to-mouth resuscitation, rhythm with radiation
iovocain ease the pain it might save him / If not, Eric B.'s the judge, the crowd's the jury
~o Rakim, what's up? / Yo, I'm doing the knowledge, E., man I'm trying to get paid in full
pell, check this out, since Norby Walters is our agency, right? / True

hkay, so who we rollin' with then? We rollin' with Rush / Of Rushtown Management
dheck this out, since we talking over / This def beat right here that I put together
n wanna hear some of them def rhymes, you know what I'm sayin'? / And together, we can get paid in fu}l
shinkin' of a master plan / 'Cuz ain't nuthin' but sweat inside my hand
to I dig into my pocket, all my money is spent / So I dig deeper but still comin' up with lint
to I start my mission, leave my residence / Thinkin' how could I get some dead presidents
n need money, I used to be a stick-up kid / So I think of all the devious things I did
n used to roll up, this is a hold up, ain't nuthin' funny / Stop smiling, be still, don't nuthin' movt 'u           
eut now I learned to earn 'cuz I'm righteous / I feel great, so maybe I might just
tearch for a nine to five, if I strive / Then maybe I'll stay alive
to I walk up the street whistlin' this / Feelin' out of place 'cuz, man, do I miss
f pen and a paper, a stereo, a tape of / Me and Eric B, and a nice big plate of
aish, which is my favorite dish / But without no money it's still a wish
Cuz I don't like to dream about gettin' paid / So I dig into the books of the rhymes that I made
to now to test to see if I got pull / Hit the studio, 'cuz I'm paid in full
uakim, check this out, yo / You go to your girl house and I'll go to mine
Cause my girl is definitely mad / 'Cause it took us too long to do this album
~o, I hear what you're saying / So let's just pump the music up
fnd count our money / Yo, well check this out, yo Eli
surn down the bass down / And let the beat just keep on rockin'
fnd we outta here / Yo, what happened to peace? / Peace
